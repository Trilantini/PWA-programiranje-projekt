(1, '2021-01-31', 'Daniel Gluhak', 'HITMAN 3', 'Agent 47 returns as a ruthless professional in HITMAN 3 for the important contracts in his entire career. Embark on an intimate journey of darkness and hope in the dramatic conclusion to the World of Assassination trilogy. Death awaits.', 'And so we have come to the end of IO Interactives so-called World of Assassination trilogy, which began with the Danish developers first Hitman reboot back in 2016. These are some of the best systems-driven stealth games on PC, and Hitman 3 tops the series off with a superb collection of levels-some of which are among the best in the entire Hitman series. This is a spiritual and mechanical continuation of the previous two games, but IO still has a few surprises up its sleeve. And one level in particular might just be the studios masterpiece.\r\n\r\nI am in an abandoned warehouse on the outskirts of Berlin. Spindly lasers and spotlights sweep across a shadowy dancefloor, revealing a sea of bobbing heads hypnotised by throbbing techno music. The music is so loud, and the bass so deep, it makes my headphones vibrate. But I am not here because Agent 47 has given up contract killing and joined the German rave scene, even though that would be a pretty funny way to end the story. I am here to murder a team of deadly assassins who are also trying to murder me.\r\n\r\nTen hitmen are patrolling the warehouse and a scrubby industrial wasteland surrounding it. And here is the kicker: they know what I look like, even if I am wearing a disguise. I can still change clothes to stroll past lowly security guards, but these trained killers are not so easily fooled. If they catch sight of me they will open fire, which means I have to rely on those swarms of pill-popping ravers, and the maze-like architecture of the building, to conceal myself.\r\n\r\nMost Hitman targets are cowards hidden away in a fortress behind a wall of armed guards, which makes these guys so thrilling to go up against. It is a totally different dynamic, and one of the challenging missions in the trilogy as a result. There are not even any Mission Stories in this level, the in-game hint system that usually suggests entertaining ways to kill your targets. This encourages you to experiment with the sandbox and dream up your own methods.\r\n\r\nTo complicate matters, the assassins are also disguised. To identify them I have to steal an earpiece and listen in on their conversations. When I catch one talking to their handler in instinct mode which highlights targets, points of interest, weapons, and so on-their cover is blown and they are marked permanently on the map. Now all I have to do is figure out how to kill them without anyone noticing, in front of thousands of witnesses, in the middle of a rave. I could just shoot them and run away, of course, but that is no way to play Hitman.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible at first. Some of the targets follow routines where they are constantly surrounded by people. One of them, the leader, even has a bodyguard who never leaves his side. But the beauty of Hitman is carefully studying these big, intricate levels, making a mental map, and finding holes in the security to exploit. When you do finally manage to kill five of these assassins - enough to send the others fleeing-it feels incredible.\r\n\r\nHITMAN 3 Gameplay\r\n\r\nThere is not much changed. In fact, you could say that Hitman 1, 2 and 3 are all the same game with little new gameplay mechanisms. Early on you will get access to a new camera gadget which allows you to hack and unlock doors and windows. However, this seems to be a forced addition just for the sake of adding something new. The old lock pick could have done the job much better. But the camera feeding into your handler does bring a certain modern outlook to the job. \r\n\r\nAnd with unlocking brings the new concept of persistent shortcuts. If you do unlock certain doors or paths in one playthrough then they remain unlocked for subsequent playthroughs. While this can be seen as a quality of life improvement, it does take away from the element of challenge from subsequent playthroughs. The devs say this opens up more opportunities, we do not see it from the same perspective.\r\n\r\nThe mansion itself is brilliantly constructed. Long, dark corridors lined with oil paintings open up into bright, lavishly decorated drawing rooms. And behind the walls there is a labyrinth of secret passages to discover with peepholes for spying on people. There is also a wonderful feeling of isolation, with the house standing alone in an expanse of barren, overcast moorland that stretches infinitely into the distance. No one makes places quite like IO Interactive, and in Hitman 3 you will find some of the developers finest creations to date.\r\n\r\nChongqing is another standout. It is a pretty straightforward mission compared to Berlin and Dartmoor, but an incredible piece of level design. Above, rain-soaked streets buzzing with fluorescent neon signs, noodle bars, apartment blocks, and winding, trash-stuffed alleyways. Below, a gleaming futuristic facility with multiple layers of security, heavily armed guards, and vent systems to slip through. This impossibly intricate double-stacked level is one of the most impressive things IO has ever created; both in terms of atmosphere and aesthetic, and in how many interesting ways there are to navigate it.\r\n\r\nHITMAN 3 Graphics\r\n\r\nWith each release in the World of Assassination trilogy, IO Interactive has significantly upgraded the graphics in the game. This is evident from the very first mission in Dubai where you parachute onto the top of the tallest building in the world and are met with a ridiculous amount of reflections that have been really well-executed. IOI has upgraded their Glacier Engine to incorporate screen space reflections along with render to texture methods to really make materials pop and seem life-like. Be it reflective glass panels, water or just shiny globes placed along the levels, the engine has really *cough* shone *cough* through. One could even say that the game puts NVIDIAs RTX to shame with their implementation of reflections. Yes, the game does not have RTX but it is not like we are feeling its absence in any way.\r\n\r\nHITMAN 3 Verdict\r\n\r\nOver the years, IO has gotten really good at designing the many small stealth challenges that litter its levels. The placement of guards, improvised weapons, blind corners, security cameras, and places to hide bodies is often pitch perfect. There are countless tiny, satisfying moments in these levels where you are given just enough to cleverly outfox the AI and use the environment to your advantage. You rarely feel backed into a corner, or in a situation you ca not find a way out of, which speaks to the quality of the games design. And as you unlock additional tools and gadgets, the sandbox only gets deeper and more varied.\r\n\r\nDespite a couple of weaker levels, Hitman 3 is a sensational stealth game. Berlin, Chongqing, and Dartmoor represent the series at its best, which is a fine way to end the trilogy. And if you own the first two games you can once Epic figures out how access all of those levels here, with improved visuals and the ability to use the new games gadgets and weapons in them. Do that, and this is easily one of the best games on PC. Hitman 3 is a magnificent videogame and a perfect swansong for Agent 47.', 'Review', 'hitman.jpg', 8, 'fun stealth gameplay', 'freedom of access and a number of gameplay options', 'impressive locations full of details', 'a predictable and tiring story', 'progress only with an internet connection', 'lack of innovation', 0),
(2, '2021-02-13', 'Daniel Gluhak', 'The Medium', 'The Medium is a story-focused third-person psychological horror game that features innovative dual-reality gameplay and an original soundtrack co-composed by Arkadiusz Reikowski and Akira Yamaoka.', '\"Let me try you on,\" a raspy voice breathes from the shadows, as we creep through the dilapidated corridors of the abandoned Niwa hotel - knowing that the creature which uttered the words could be waiting around the next corridor. Yet we know, from the hours already spent with The Medium, that this creature, the Maw, would not simply jump out on me - that would be too easy. Instead, we will stumble upon it in the next room, its sheer appearance alone, combined with its intent to wear me like a glove, enough to send shivers down my spine. But we can not even be sure that will happen, this is not a game that is easy to predict.\r\n\r\nAnd that is the beauty of Bloober Teams The Medium. It never feels the need to inundate you with jump scares, which soon lose their impact, or to throw every horror cliché in the book at you from the word \"go\". Instead, the tension is built slowly and deliberately. When you think you know what to expect from this psychological thriller, the formula is changed up once again creating a constant sense of unease.\r\n\r\nWhile that unease does fill you with dread over the 11-hour playtime, that is not the developers only ambition: instead Bloober Team have crafted a story full of twists that makes you want to persevere and unearth the mysteries of the Niwa hotel - and what ties it to our medium protagonist, Marianne. \r\n\r\nThe Medium brings classic fixed-camera horror to the modern day, which we have seen with the likes of Until Dawn, but makes sure to add its own touch through the `split` feature that sees Marianne moving between both the `real` world and the spirit world, adding a new dimension to the puzzle elements we have seen in similar titles such as the early entries in the Resident Evil series. And while there are some pacing issues in the latter part of the game, and the story can be at times hard to keep up with, it proves that Boober Team has the perfect formula for scaring the sh** out of us.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt all started with a dead girl\r\n\r\nOn paper, The Mediums story could be misconstrued as another stereotypical horror game. You play as Marianne, a powerful Medium, who is able to exist in two different realities: the `real` world and the spirit world. Haunted by images of a dead girl, Marianne travels to the dilapidated Niwa Hotel, following a tip that the rundown resort may hold the secrets to the visions and her past.\r\n\r\nThe Medium sees Bloober Team leaning into its Polish history, with the game set in post-communist Poland  a thread that runs throughout the heart of the games narrative. As such, the Niwa resort is the epitome of brutalist architecture, cold and vast, the perfect setting to keep you uneasy: you are certainly not welcome here.\r\n\r\nMariannes traversal of the Niwa is all pretty linear, with the game setting a clear path ahead of you for where you are meant to go, and fairly straightforward clues as to how you get there. Most of your progression relies on solving puzzles: primarily finding the applicable item to use which will remove the obstacle in your way and allow you to move forward or uncovering the item that unearths more of the story. This is a tried and tested method which has worked well for the likes of Resident Evil, but Bloober puts its own stamp on it with the inclusion of the `split` feature. \r\n\r\nAs previously mentioned, Marianne exists in both the `real` world and the spirit world. In the real word she sees things as any of us would (which means she ca not see some things, but we will come back to that later), but in the spirit world the Niwa turns into a hellish nightmare realm strewn in decomposing bodies, black tar and the occasional creeping tentacle. For the most part, we play as Marianne in the real world, however at certain points in the game the screen splits, showing in real-time Marianne existing in both the real world and spirit world. This is the key to a lot of The Mediums puzzle-solving, as there are instances when Marianne sees things in the spirit world which she ca not see in the real world, and vice versa. \r\n\r\nIn some cases, Marianne can also \"drop out\" of her body, allowing you to play solely in the spirit world. This is handy in instances when Mariannes path is blocked by an object in the real world, but is passable in the spirit world, as it means she can drop out of her body, pass the obstacle in the spirit world, and then in the spirit world solve the issue that is obstructing her way in the real world. So, for example, in one instance, Marianne is trying to use an elevator but the elevator has not got any power. While she can not pass through the doors of the elevator in the real world, she can in the spirit world, so you drop out of her body and see that there is a power box just outside the elevator door. You can then quickly search the spirit world for a spirit well, which Marianne can absorb energy from to use certain abilities, and then return to the power box and use an energy blast on it - charging the power box and therefore springing the elevator back into life in both worlds.\r\n\r\nThe split feature adds an extra layer to The Mediums puzzle solving, making you think a bit more about how to approach puzzles rather than simply finding a key and putting it in the door. In addition, you only have a certain amount of time that you can stay solely in the spirit world, as Marianne disintegrates the longer you stay, until she eventually dies. There is no set time on how long this takes according to Bloober, who compared it to depleting oxygen in games where you can swim underwater. Essentially just move as quickly and efficiently as you can.\r\n\r\nBut despite this refreshing approach, these puzzles are not particularly difficult and at times it felt like the solution was a bit too simple, given the linearity of the game there is only so many places you can search for the item you need. While there is some time to explore each room you are in, and plenty of echoes and memories to uncover which flesh out the storys plot, if you miss your chance to uncover them then it is too late, you are quickly moved on to the next area with little chance of retracing previous steps.\r\n\r\nWe wish there were more opportunities to explore Niwa for ourselves, as at times it feels like we were being bustled through the game, with Bloober holding our hand every step of the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nA story let down by pacing in the end game\r\n\r\nAt times this restriction works to The Mediums advantage, as it creates a sense of confinement when encountering Niwas more unwelcome resident. As mentioned previously, the games main antagonist is The Maw, a tall, spindly creature with a whipping tongue, tattered wings and which inexplicably enjoys walking around on its tippy toes. Voiced by Troy Baker (yep), this creature is wildly unnerving, muttering skin-crawling threats at you when it comes in close proximity. Marianne can only see this creature when in the spirit world, where she can protect herself to some degree using the energy she gathers from the spirit well, but in the real world it appears as only a faint outline, with the only options being to outwit it or stealth around it. \r\n\r\nWhile the Maw plays an integral role in The Mediums story, it begins to lose its fear factor the more you encounter it. There are occasions when Bloober shakes things up, having the adversary approach you in a different way and in those moments it had our heart racing. But those seemed to become less and less as the game progressed, as the game leaned more into the story than the horror.\r\n\r\nThat is not such a bad thing, however, as the story is gripping. We found ourselves hooked from the start, intrigued to unearth more of Niwas secrets and how Bloober weaved Polands history into the narrative. There are twists aplenty too and the game goes in directions we did not necessarily expect. In the first three-quarters of the game or so, this overarching story is well-paced, letting you slowly uncover what exactly is happening. However, in the latter part of the game (without spoilers) - and arguably the most critical the pacing loses its footing and it almost feels rushed. There is a lot of information flying at you at once and while you can get the gist of what is happening, the finer details are easy to lose several days later we are still trying to piece together some parts despite picking up every collectible we could. Miss a key line, and you may be completely lost. \r\n\r\nIt is a real shame as we were completely taken in by The Medium for the most part. If we had been given more time to marinate on the bigger revelations in the endgame, given more time to breathe, then it would have done wonders for the impact of the story.\r\n\r\n\r\nClassic horror modernized\r\n\r\nWhile there is some aspects where The Medium falters, the atmosphere is not one. Bloober does a fantastic job of making you feel consistently uneasy, through both the previously mentioned environment of Niwa and its wonderfully crafted score. One The Mediums biggest flexes is that its score has been jointly composed by Silent Hill composer Akira Yamaoka and Bloober Teams own Arkadiusz Reikowski. While Yamaoka was tasked with composing the spirit worlds score, Reikowski scored the real world. \r\n\r\nThe two scores work brilliantly both together and standalone, with shift between the two scores being immediately obvious as you step from one world into the other. While the spirit world is immediately haunting, laced with intermittent chimes and melancholy vocal sounds, in contrast, the real world score gives us major 80s horror vibes thanks to its heavy use of a synthesiser similar, in many ways, to Stranger Things.\r\n\r\nAnd it is not just the score with harks back to classic horrors of days gone, The Medium features a fixed camera, a la Silent Hill and classic Resident Evil. While we do not see this camera angle used much in modern games, it does wonders in creating the constant feeling that you are being watched - though may be difficult to get used to for those who have not played classic horrors.\r\n\r\nAll this comes together to make a game that feels like a fitting tribute to these titans of the genre. It creates an unpredictability to The Medium that sees players constantly on edge from the fear of the unknown, rather than expecting a jump scare when it seems fitting to have one. The Medium only has one jump scare and, when it is used, it absolutely works because you never expected it in the first place. \r\n\r\n\r\nVerdict\r\n\r\nThe Medium is smarter than your average horror game. Rather than relying on jump scares for cheap thrills, it does a brilliant job of slowly building an atmosphere that has you on edge throughout. But this is not a game that is just about scaring the bejesus out of you, there is also a well-crafted story here that contains plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing - and that add to the games unpredictability - while the split feature adds an extra layer to the classic puzzle element.\r\n\r\nHowever, The Medium is let down by its poor pacing in the endgame that could see you losing track of its story if you do not pay close attention, and which tries to do a lot (maybe too much) in a short space of time after all the game is just 11 hours long. We also found that we wanted more of an opportunity to explore The Mediums world and, at times, it felt like we were being shoved along in the story with little time to breathe or take in our surroundings.

(3, '2021-04-03', 'Daniel Gluhak', 'It Takes Two', 'Embark on the craziest journey of your life in It Takes Two. Invite a friend to join for free with Friends Pass and work together across a huge variety of gleefully disruptive gameplay challenges.', 'It takes a bold man to risk thousands of dollars on the promise that no-one will find their game boring. But Josef Fares is just that brazen. After watching the credits roll on his latest co-op adventure, it is clear that his confidence was well placed (and plentiful), as It Takes Two is anything but dull. The latest title from Fares studio, Hazelight, It Takes Two explores themes of relationships, divorce, and parenthood, with you and a friend taking control of a husband and wife duo at the end of their tether - sometimes quite literally. \r\n\r\nMay and Cody, buckling under the pressures of balancing work and family life, have decided to get a divorce. However, the moment they tell their young daughter Rose, she enlists the aid of a self-help book to get her family back together, and manages to trap her parents inside two small dolls. Cody becomes a chubby clay man with a leaf for hair, while May is a little wooden figure with knitted clothing, and neither of them can be reunited with their daughter until they learn to work together.\r\n\r\n\r\nCouples counseling\r\n\r\nLike Fares previous titles - A Way Out and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons - It Takes Two relies solely on co-operative gameplay, with the game being impossible to play unless you team up with someone either locally or online. Handily, there is a Friends Pass feature that allows you to invite a friend to join you for free, meaning it is very easy to enjoy the co-op action without having to rely on your pals purchasing decisions. For this review though, I played the game with my partner on the sofa, with both of us thoroughly enjoying every moment of It Takes Twos circa 15-hour runtime. \r\n\r\nThat enjoyment is derived largely from It Takes Twos constant experimentation with new gameplay mechanics and ideas, resulting in a campaign that never feels like it is repeating anything. It is part of Fares elevator pitch, and it works a treat. Co-op puzzles are not just about good timing and watching each other is backs, they are about using the skills each of the games sections gives to you. At one point May has a hammer, but Cody has the nails. It is not always as straightforward as that example (although It Takes Two never does quite what you expect it to), either, as later you wll be given more obscure powers like the ability to change size or turn into various plants as Cody, and anti-grav space boots or the power to create a clone of yourself as May.\r\n\r\nIt Takes Two always manages to surprise you, using each mechanic in a multitude of ways to the point that almost no ideas are used moren a handful of times. Working out how the game keeps innovating by using the various elements in isolation and as a partnership is incredibly rewarding - and a seriously impressive feat of game design. \r\n\r\nThen there is the fact that the world keeps changing around you. Because you are a pair of dolls, there is very much a Honey I Shrunk The Kids meets Toy Story vibe to how the game plays out. It Takes Two excels in its ability to make the mundane exciting. Rose leaves the pair of dolls in the shed hidden away, so initially, your task is to get back to her in the main house. Between the two lie plenty of perils, including a particularly irate aging vacuum cleaner that is equally annoyed with Cody for sucking up debris he should not have, and May for not fixing it sooner. tha\r\n\r\nLater on, you will get back to the house and your focus will change. You are back with your daughter but you are still dolls, so the focus shifts from Rose to the couple themselves. Thus, your anthropomorphic - and strangely sexual - book-shaped love doctor guide becomes a more prominent presence in the game, leading you through various sessions to help fix Cody and Mays marriage. To match that more introspective shift, the gameplay moves to locations that are a little more fantastical and themed around their life together, like the inside of a snowglobe or the ever-shifting insides of a cuckoo clock.\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo halves make a whole\r\n\r\nThat structure can make the game feel a little like it is split into two halves, its mid-game shift potentially leaving players with a mild case of tonal whiplash. But, regardless, everything continues to be larger than life and utterly beautiful throughout the entirety of It Takes Two, consistently sticking to its promise to keep innovating and delivering with each new level and mechanic. Each chapter offers plenty to discover, too, and there are moments where the story takes a step back to simply let you explore. \r\n\r\nWhether it is Roses bedroom or an overrun greenhouse, start looking off the beaten track and there are secrets to uncover, including wonderfully quirky mini-games tucked away to discover. Look out for a gently tingling tambourine noise and you will find them easy enough, each offering a competitive experience that balances nicely against the co-operative nature of the core game. And like the game is ever-changing mechanics, they have got fantastic range too, offering things like snail races, whack-a-mole, and even a fully-fledged chess game.\r\n\r\nBut the thing that holds these two halves together perfectly is the games realistic presentation of human relationships. Speaking as a child of divorce, I have seen first hand the little bickering molehills that turn into the mountains forcing a couple apart. They are perfectly captured in May and Codys story, which highlights the often simple things that can ruin a good relationship. Whether it is the argument about the vacuum or the bigger discussions about Mays job as an engineer, you see so much of their lives play out in between solving puzzles or riding frogs. \r\n\r\nIt may not be an entirely smooth resolution at the end, but it is that journey and their portrayal as real characters. They are people that could be your neighbors, or even a relative. They live simple lives (at least before the antics of It Takes Two, anyway), and worry about real, tangible things, and that is refreshing. It may deal with those against a backdrop of fantasy and spectacle, but the issues it tackles are familiar - and sometimes a little too close to home. Plus, there is a particularly harrowing scene with the attempted murder of a cuddly toy elephant that may well stay with me for many years. \r\n\r\n\r\nVERDICT\r\n\r\nIt Takes Two is a unique experience that makes the most of what it means to offer truly co-operative gameplay. Your relationship with whoever you are playing with is just as important as that of May and Cody, as you will get nowhere without robust communication and teamwork. But its blend of reality and fantasy is also refreshingly different, especially within a framework that offers the kind of unique gameplay that never stops surprising.', 'Review', 'it takes two.jpg', 10, 'Fantastic co-op gameplay', 'Constantly evolving mechanics', 'Beautiful worlds to explore', 'Can feel like a game of two halves', '', '', 0),

In November, however, a different title set a new record: a sealed copy of Super Mario Bros. 3 sold for $156,000, making it the most expensive video game ever sold until today.\r\n\r\nHere is what makes the version of Super Mario Bros. that sold today so special, according to Heritage Auctions:\r\n\r\n\r\n\" Not only is this the finest plastic-sealed copy with a perforated cardboard hangtab we have ever offered of any black box title, it is also the oldest sealed copy of Super Mario Bros. we have ever had the opportunity to offer. This is only the fourth version of Super Mario Bros. ever produced, and its window of production was remarkably short. Just to paint a better picture of how short this really was the nationwide release for the console came in mid to late 1986, and black box games distributed for that release did not have the \"Game Pak NES-GP\" code. It is worth mentioning that Nintendo managed to add the trademark symbol to the Nintendo Entertainment System on their game boxes by the beginning of 1987. That certainly does not leave much time at all for this variant to be produced in-between the two! \"', 'News', 'mario.jpg', 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 0),

The news was announced by Ubisoft in an official blog post', 'The new performance mode will be introduced as part of Title Update 4.5, which is expected to go live on June 1. Alongside the performance mode, players will see the introduction of cross-generation gameplay, so that players can enjoy the games multiplayer with friends within the console same family. That means that players on Xbox Series X/S will be able to play with those on Xbox One, while PS5 players will have the option to play with those on PS4.\r\n\r\nOriginally scheduled for release at the end of May, Ubisoft explained that it pushed update 4.5 back \"to make sure that the different teams working on separate pieces of content have the time they need to create the best game experiences possible.\"\r\n\r\nUbisoft also hopes that the extra time will allow its teams to fix some of the bugs found in the previous 4.0 update and perhaps even add some more Quality of Life improvements to the game.\r\n\r\nUbisofts updated roadmap also details some other additions to the game players can expect further down the line. In July, the 5.0 Title Update will introduce The Bloodline Story DLC as well as bring the characters Aiden and Wrench into the main game. \r\n\r\nThen, in August, players will see the introduction of Invasion and Extraction PVP modes. Initially expected earlier, Ubisoft has moved them to the August update in order \"to invest more time into solid public & private matchmaking\", explaining that \"it is key for us to provide you with a smooth, enjoyable PvP experience.\"', 'News', 'wdLegion.jpg', 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 1),

But now that Sonys gamepad is compatible with iOS 14.5, iPadOS 14.5, tvOS 14.5 and macOS 11.3, it makes sense.', 'Apple seems to have no qualms about recommending the PS5 DualSense Controller to its users.  The DualSense controller is listed for the same price as other retailers, thankfully - $69.95 - and orders placed today (May 21) are due to be delivered next week. We have not seen the controller listed on Apples UK store, as of yet.\r\nThe PS5 DualSense controller can be used with any controller-supported games on Apple devices, including those found on Apple Arcade. You can also use the DualSense with the PS Remote Play app, which lets you stream your PS5 games to your phone or tablet.\r\nWe are huge fans of the DualSense controller, and even though you would not be able to experience the wonders of its haptic feedback and adaptive controllers when playing on Apple devices, it is still incredibly comfortable to use and has a pleasing battery life.\r\nOf course, millions of people are still trying to secure a PS5 console of their own, with Sonys next-gen system continuing to flash in and out of stock at various retailers. We are doing everything we can to help you find where to buy a PS5, so check out our PS5 restock tracker for more information.\r\n\r\nSuits Sony\r\n\r\nInterestingly, even though Apples devices are also compatible with Xbox Wireless Controllers, Apple does not list Microsofts new pad for sale. We would argue that this would actually be a better option, mostly due to the fact it is cheaper at $59.99 / £54.99 / AU$89.95 and is the perfect controller for Xbox Game Pass, something which is now being tested on iOS devices after initially being blocked by Apple.\r\n\r\nSony recently announced two new PS5 DualSense controller colors: Midnight Black and Cosmic Red, which are available to pre-order now. \r\n', 'News', 'ps5.jpg', 0, '', '', '', '', '', '', 1);
